# Human_AI_Interaction_COMP3074

## Chatbot Design
The first coursework of the module COMP3074 Human-AI Interaction is about building a simple Question Answering (QA) Chatbot. For the coding part of the coursework, all codes are implemented in Python and some of them are modified or reused based on the lab examples and exercises. 

In the report, the design of the system is comprehensively delivered, including intent matching, name management, small talk, and question answering, followed by a description of some ‘smart’ functionalities. Next, the evaluation of the system is critically demonstrated based on testing feedback. Lastly, how the system will be improved in the future is further discussed.


## VoiceFlow
The second coursework of the module COMP3074 Human-AI Interaction is about the topic of designing and building a task-driven conversational app. To meet the requirements of this coursework, I have designed a Voiceflow-based prototype ‘SUPERFOOD’ that supports food home delivery ordering. 

In the report, the design of the prototype, following the user-centred design process, is comprehensively delivered, including, explanations of relevant VUI design principles, followed by a description of advanced features. Lastly, self-reflective writing, as well as future directions, is presented.
